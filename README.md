**<ins>Ticket Key Points:<ins>**
    <ul>
      <li>Finance gets IP addresses, but IPs are strange, don't belong to expected subnet</li>
      <li>Finance pings to OPs work sometimes, but inconsistent</li>
      <li>Operations see occasional weird behaviour when trying to reach finance</li>
      <li>Network team did some trunk optimisation work between D1 and access switches yesterday
    </ul>
</ol>
<br>

**<ins>Step 1: Layer 1 <ins>**
    <ul>
      <li>Checked cabling on every connection, to make sure right cables were used </li>
      <li>Noticed **incorrect cabling** between **SW-Finance**, **SW-OPs** and the **D1**.</li>
      <li>Replaced **crossover cable** with a straight through cable. Having incorrect cabling could cause inconssistent pings due to collisions from to pins transmitting at same time. Maybe the network team made a mistake yesterday?</li>
      <li>The next step was the interfaces, to check for possible **down interfaces**. I useed `show ip interface brief` on the two swtiches, as well as the layer 3 switch.
      <li>I checked the **SW-Finance** first, on which there were no alarming things. Connected interfaces were up/up as expected </li>
      <li>I then checked **SW-OPs** and i got a native VLAN mismatch message for the trunk between `GigabitEthernet0/1` on **SW-OP** and `FastEthernet0/1` on **D1** <br>
      </ul>
